The line plot above shows the monthly percentage change in residential property prices in Dublin. The x-axis represents the months, and the y-axis represents the percentage change in house prices.

Here are a few observations:

Volatility: The percentage change in property prices seems to fluctuate quite a bit over time.

Trends: While it's hard to discern a clear upward or downward trend from the plot alone, there are periods where the percentage change rises and falls.

Seasonality: There doesn't appear to be a strong seasonal pattern in the data, but further analysis would be needed to confirm this.
